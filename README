 Web of Trust statistics and pathfinder, Wotsap

This package contains the code used at
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jc/wotsap/.

README:

  This file.

wotsap.py:

  The main Wotsap Python module. It also works as a standalone
  program, but right now it only produces quite boring text graphs. 
  The statistics is identical though.

Webware-Main.py:

  Glue between wotsap.py and Webware
  (http://webware.sourceforge.net/).

Webware-Redirect.py:

  Simple Webware module which does nothing but redirect to a specified
  URL.

pks2wot.py:

  A program to create .wot files using the pksclient program. You need
  a local keyserver to use it. It should be fairly easy to adopt it to
  client programs for other keyservers.

wotfileformat.txt:

  Specification for the .wot file format.

index.html:

  A sample xhtml page with forms to query Wotsap.
