 Web of trust statistics and pathfinder, Wotsap

Wotsap is a tool that analyzes a OpenPGP Web of Trust description and
reports to the user stastistics about the single keys and the whole
network, or searches for paths from one key to another.

This package was originally developed by Jörgen Cederlöf at
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~jc/wotsap/. Most documentation is available
on the web pages. The development there is now frozen and continues on
https://github.com/giomasce/wotsap. Every contribution is welcome!

  A program to create .wot files using the pksclient program. You need
