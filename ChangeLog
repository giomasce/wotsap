        Loads of changes, too many to list in detail, most of them
        actually implemented some time ago. Everything is optimized for
        Python 2.3 and should work on Python 2.4 but still has
        compatibility for Python 2.2.

        * pks2wot.py:
                     - All keys and signatures verified with GnuPG
                     - Always use primary user ID
                     - Indicate if primary user ID is signed
                     - Save signature type
                     - New .wot file format including signature types
                     - Safe caching and other speedups
        * wotsap.py:
                     - Handle new .wot file format
                     - Most Wanted patch by Marco Bodrato
                     - Group matrix
                     - Modstrings
                     - Handles signature types
                     - Better command line options handling
                     - Can show all differences between two .wot files
                     - No external font files are needed
