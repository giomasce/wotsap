	Release 0.7

	Most of these changes are somewhat old and have been running on
	the online service for quite some time. This is an incomplete
	list:

        * pks2wot:
                     - Some typo fixes.
                     - Check expiration of signatures.
                     - Removed Zimmerman's key 0x63CB691DFAEBD5FC from
                         startkeys, since it has signed noone.
                     - Use pksclient --version.
        * wotsap:
                     - Some URL changes in documentation texts.
                     - Open files in binary mode, to make it work on Microsoft
                         systems.
                     - Use unified_diff instead of ndiff for debug info. ndiff
                         is very very slow (years?) for the debug data.
                     - Optional email obfuscation
                     - Show information about reaching/reachable/strong set
                         with modstring.
                     - Added --size option.
                     - Added --nounknowns option.
                     - Made --group do search if key string doesn't contain a
                         comma.
                     - Some small improvements of e.g. error handling.
                     - Optionally use TrueType font.
                     - DOT file export by
                         Aleksey Shipilev <aleksey.shipilev@gmail.com>

        Release 0.6
        
        Loads of changes, too many to list in detail, most of them
        actually implemented some time ago. Everything is optimized for
        Python 2.3 and should work on Python 2.4 but still has
        compatibility for Python 2.2.

        * pks2wot:
                     - All keys and signatures verified with GnuPG
                     - Always use primary user ID
                     - Indicate if primary user ID is signed
                     - Save signature type
                     - New .wot file format including signature types
                     - Safe caching and other speedups
        * wotsap:
                     - Handle new .wot file format
                     - Most Wanted patch by Marco Bodrato
                     - Group matrix
                     - Modstrings
                     - Handles signature types
                     - Better command line options handling
                     - Can show all differences between two .wot files
                     - No external font files are needed
